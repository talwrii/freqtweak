   Value LFO, and Randomize

Version 0.5.1

Version 0.5.0
 * arbitrarily selectable and reorderable modules
 * preset blending feature
 * two new modules: limiter and warp
 * new preset format (conversion script included: ft_preset_convert.py)
 * internal design cleanup

Version 0.4.8

 * no longer restores ports by default when loading presets,
   made it an option.

Version 0.4.7
 * fixed tempo=0 bug
 * new gcc and 64 bit fixes

Version 0.4.6
 * Many stability fixes
 * Grid and grid snap options
 * optional tempo based grid for delay time
 * THIS time I did finally fix the FFT changing problems!
 * Added adjustable max delay time levels (up to 20secs)
 * Pitch now uses semitones as units
 * Min/max legend text on plots. 


Version 0.4.5
 * This time, I think I might have licked the changing FFT sizes problem!

 * now uses the alsa_pcm conventions from JACK 0.40 for default connections

 * added disconnect (from JACK) button to IO tab


Version 0.4.4
 * Now deactivates processing while switching FFT sizes. This
   should prevent JACK from kicking us out here.

 * Added ability to reconnect to JACK with a different basename,
   or just reconnect if we are kicked out.

 * Control-Alt left mouse draws arbitrary straight lines between
   initial click and current cursor.  Also smoothed regular drawing.
