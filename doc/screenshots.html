    All rows are resizable and minimizable.  This example shows a
      variety of frequency scales and plot types chosen, also note
      that a few of the filters are bypassed.   Compare the spectragrams
      on channel 1 to see what the Delay filter is doing to the
      audio.

    Yes, it is as fun as it looks....
