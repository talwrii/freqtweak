	    FreqTweak is a tool for FFT-based realtime audio spectral manipulation and
	    display.  It provides several algorithms for processing audio data in
	    the frequency domain and a highly interactive GUI to manipulate the
	    associated filters for each. It also provides high-resolution spectral
	    displays in the form of scrolling-raster spectrograms and
	    energy vs frequency plots displaying both pre- and post-processed spectra.
	    <p>
	      It is an extremely addictive audio toy, 
	      but I hope it has value for serious audio work too
	      (sound design, etc).  The spectrum analysis is
	      pretty useful in its own right.

	    FreqTweak supports manipulating the spectral filters at several frequency resolutions
	    (64,128,256,512,1024,2048, or 4096 bands) depending on your
	    needs/resources.   Overlap and windowing are also selectable.
	    <p>
	    The GUI filter graph manipulators (and analysis plots)
	    have selectable frequency scale types: 1x and 2x linear, and two log
	    scales to help with modulating the musical frequencies.
	      Filters can be linked across multiple channels.
	    The plots are resizable and  zoomable (y-axis) to allow precise 
            editing of filter values.

	    <p>
	    The current processing filters are described below in the
	    order audio is processed in the chain.  Any or all of the
	    filters can be bypassed.  The state of all filters
	      can be stored or loaded as presets.
	    <p>
	    <ul>
	      <li> <b>Spectral Analysis</b> -- <font size=-1>
		  Multicolor scrolling-raster spectrogram, or energy
		  vs. freq line or bar plots... one shows
		  pre-processed, another shows post-processed.
		  </font>

	      <li> <b>EQ Cut/Boost</b> -- <font size=-1>
		  Your basic multi-band frequency attenuation.  But
		  you get an unhealthy number of bands...  Note that this EQ is not intended for
		  mastering purposes, it allows for (and doesn't protect against) highly irregular
		  filtering. Two versions, one does only frequency gain
		  cut, the other boost.

		  </font>
		
	      <li> <b>Pitch Scaling</b> -- <font size=-1>
		  This is an interesting application
		of Sprengler's pitch scaling algorithm (used in
		Steve Harris' LADSPA <a
					href="http://plugin.org.uk">plugin</a>).
		If you keep all the bins at the same scale, it is
		equivalent to Steve's plugin, but when you start
		applying different scales per frequency bin, things
		quickly get weird.  For highest quality results (at the expense of transients) use
                larger FFT (&gt;= 1024 bins).
		  </font>
		
	      <li> <b>Gate</b> -- <font size=-1>
		  This is a double filter where
		a given frequency band is allowed to pass through
		(unaltered)
		if the power on that band is between two dB
		thresholds... otherwise its gain is clamped to 0.
		</font>

	      <li> <b>Delay</b> -- <font size=-1>
		  This lets you delay the audio
		on a per frequency-bin basis yielding some pretty wild
		effects (or subtle, if you are careful).  A feedback
		filter controls the feedback of the delay per bin (be
		  careful with this one).
		This is basically what Native Instrument's
		<a
		   href="http://www.nativeinstruments.de/index.php?id=444&type=1">
		  Spektral-Delay</a> accomplishes.  Granted, I don't
		have all the automated filter modulations (yet ;).
		See their website for audio examples of what is
		possible with this cool effect.

		  </font>

	      <li> <b>Limit</b> -- <font size=-1>
		This is very harsh brick wall limiter on a per-bin
		basis.  It is not very pleasant, but can be interesting.
		</font>

	      <li> <b>Compressor</b> -- <font size=-1>
			  This is a massively multiband compressor.
			  It will not behave quite like a normal
			  time-domain compressor because of the
			  inherent block processing of the FFT.  Each
			  frequency bin has its own compressor
			  complete with Threshold, Ratio,
			  Attack/Release time, and makeup gain.
			  This is *not* suitable for mastering applications!
			</font>
			
	      <li> <b>Warp</b> -- <font size=-1>
		  This one is a little different, both axes represent
		  frequency, and the identity matrix is unaltered
		  audio.  Changing the value (height) of a bin,
		  reallocates the energy at that frequency to the new
		  frequency bin represented by the height of the bar.
		  For instance, if all bins are the same height, all
		  the frequency energy is added to a single bin.  This
		  is a sensitive filter, the Log frequency scale is helpful here
		  (it affects both axes).
		  </font>
			

		    </ul>

<p>
		      
 Modulators to an filter can be attached from the Modulations Window
 (Control->Modulators...   Ctrl-M).  Add a modulator by clicking
 on the Add Modulator... button and select from the choices.  To
 attach a modulator to a filter, click on the Attach... button on the
 modulator panel and pick a filter.  You can modulate many filters
 simultaneously.   The text entry fields can be used to exactly set
 the slider values, by pressing enter/return after entering the number.
<p>
	      
 The following modulators are
 currently implemented, with more to come soon.

	    <ul>
	      <li> <b>Rotate</b> -- <font size=-1>

		  This will continually shift a filter horizontally at a constant
            definable Rate, wrapping when it reaches the edge.  The edges
            are definable with the Min and Max Freq controls.

		  </font>
		
	      
	      <li> <b>Rotate LFO</b> -- <font size=-1>

             The same as the above, except the shifting rate oscillates via LFO
            with its own Rate and Depth controls.  Currently there are sine, triangle,
	    and square waveform shapes.  The frequency range that the modulator affects
            is definable with the Min and Max Freq controls.
		  </font>

	      <li> <b>Value LFO</b> -- <font size=-1>
		  
            Shifts the values up and down with an LFO.  The depth control
            here is percentage
            of total value range.  The frequency range that the modulator affects
            is definable with the Min and Max Freq controls.
		  </font>

	      <li> <b>Randomize</b> -- <font size=-1>
		  Randomizes the bin values between the given value bounds
            (as percentages of total range).  Again, the frequency range
            that the modulator affects is definable with the Min and Max Freq controls.
