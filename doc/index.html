	    FreqTweak is a tool for FFT-based realtime audio spectral manipulation and
	    display.  It provides several algorithms for processing audio data in
	    the frequency domain and a highly interactive GUI to manipulate the
	    associated filters for each. It also provides high-resolution spectral
	    displays in the form of scrolling-raster spectragrams and
	    energy vs frequency plots displaying both pre- and post-processed spectra.
	    <p>
	      It is an extremely addictive audio toy, I have to pry
	      myself away from playing with it so I can <i>work</i>
	      on it!
	      I hope it has value for serious audio work too
	      (sound design, etc).  The spectrum analysis is
	      pretty useful in its own right.
	    
	    <h3>Features</h3>

	    FreqTweak supports manipulating the spectral filters at several frequency resolutions
	    (64,128,256,512,1024, or 2048 bands) depending on your
	    needs/resources.   Overlap and windowing are also selectable.
	    <p>
	    The GUI filter graph manipulators (and analysis plots)
	    have selectable frequency scale types: 1x and 2x linear, and two log
	    scales to help with modulating the musical frequencies.
	      Filters can be linked across multiple channels.
	    The plots are resizable and  zoomable (y-axis) to allow precise 
            editing of filter values.

	    <p>
	    The current processing filters are described below in the
	    order audio is processed in the chain.  Any or all of the
	    filters can be bypassed.  The state of all filters
	      can be stored or loaded as presets.
	    <p>
	    <ul>
	      <li> <b>Spectral Analysis</b> -- <font size=-1>
		  Multicolor scrolling-raster spectragram, or energy
		  vs. freq line or bar plots... one shows
		  pre-processed, another shows post-processed.
		  </font>

	      <li> <b>EQ</b> -- <font size=-1>
		  Your basic multi-band frequency attenuation.  But
		  you get an unhealthy number of bands...
		  </font>
		
	      <li> <b>Pitch Scaling</b> -- <font size=-1>
		  This is an interesting application
		of Sprengler's pitch scaling algorithm (used in
		Steve Harris' LADSPA <a
					href="http://plugin.org.uk">plugin</a>).
		If you keep all the bins at the same scale, it is
		equivalent to Steve's plugin, but when you start
		applying different scales per frequency bin, things
		quickly get weird.
		  </font>
		
	      <li> <b>Gate</b> -- <font size=-1>
		  This is a double filter where
		a given frequency band is allowed to pass through
		(unaltered)
		if the power on that band is between two dB
		thresholds... otherwise its gain is clamped to 0.
		</font>

	      <li> <b>Delay</b> -- <font size=-1>
		  This lets you delay the audio
		on a per frequency-bin basis yielding some pretty wild
		effects (or subtle, if you are careful).  A feedback
		filter controls the feedback of the delay per bin (be
		  careful with this one).
		This is basically what Native Instrument's
		<a
		   href="http://www.nativeinstruments.de/index.php?id=444&type=1">
		  Spektral-Delay</a> accomplishes.  Granted, I don't
		have all the automated filter modulations (yet ;).
		See their website for audio examples of what is
		possible with this cool effect.

	    </ul>
	    
	    <h3>Requirements</h3>
	    <ul compact>
	      <li> <a href="http://jackit.sf.net">JACK</a> --
		<font size=-1>
		providing
		realtime low-latency audio interconnection and
		delivery.  JACK requires the <a
					    href="http://www.alsa-project.org">
		  ALSA</a> Linux sound drivers so you'll
		  need those too.   If you haven't used JACK before
		please study the <a href="http://www.djcj.org">Linux
		  Audio User Guide</a> and make sure to read the
		section on JACK.
		  </font>
	      <li> <a href="http://www.fftw.org">FFTW</a> --
		<font size=-1>for speedy FFT processing  (compiled as
		single-precision)</font>

	      <li> <a href="http://www.wxwindows.org">wxWindows</a>
		<font size=-1>
		(wxGTK) -- the GUI toolkit I've chosen to use.
		It should work with the most recent 2.2.x and 2.3.x series.
		Why not GTK?  I happen to know wx better at
		the moment...
		  </font>
	    </ul>

	    <h3>Misc Usage Tips</h3>

	    <font size=-1>
	    <ul>
	      <li> Left button click/drag to draw filters.  If Control
		is down, the y-axis is fixed at the last cursor
		location (to draw nice horizontal lines).

	      <li> Right button drag to move filters around in
		space.  The filters
		wrap around the left/right edges unless you hold down
		Control.  Dragging with both left and right buttons
		down moves both primary and alternate together (on Gate).

	      <li> Holding Shift modifies the alternate filter (on
		double filter graphs like Gate) for the previous
		operations.  
		
	      <li> Middle-button pops up frequency axis menu.

	      <li> Ctrl-Alt right-click resets a filter to default
		values.

	      <li> Shift-Ctrl-Alt Left-Drag zooms in on the y axis.
	      Look at the status bar to see the values for the cursor
	      itself and the values of the filter at the cursor's
	      frequency.  Shift-Ctrl-Alt Right click-release resets
	      the Y-zoom to full.  
	      
	      
		<li> The B and BA buttons mean Bypass and Bypass All
		respectively.
		<li> The L and LA buttons mean Link and Link All
		respectively.


      <li>  Here is an example of using freqtweak with an alsaplayer feeding it
	      and output going to speakers (alsa_pcm:out_?) without using a JACK patchbay:
	      <br>
	      Start freqtweak first with this command line: <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;freqtweak -i none,none -n ft  &amp; 
		<p>
              [ you will see some jack errors, ignore them.. they are intentional ]
		<p>
             Start alsaplayer like so: <p>

                   &nbsp;&nbsp; alsaplayer -o jack -d ft:in_1,ft:in_2  &amp; 
                  
	      
	    </ul>
	  </font>

	    <h3> TODO </h3>
	    <font size=-1>
	    <ul>
	    <li> Fix known bugs
	    <li> Support reordering of processing modules
	      <li> Automated filter modulation (via plugins?)
	      <li> Plot performance optimizations (OpenGL?)
	      <li> Whatever else the users want :)
	      </ul>
